# iOS/Swift Assignments

These projects were developed for class assignments and they are part of the phase when I started wrapping up my postgraduate program at the Conestoga College.

Assignments in this repo:

1. **QuoteApp**: this first assignment is pretty simple but it can show some of my code and UI decisions.
2. **TodoApp**: To Do app persisting data using SQLite Database (*coming soon...*)
3. *more and more...*
